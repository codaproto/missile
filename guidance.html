  This is transcribed from an Air Force training video
  on the topic of missile guidance.  The actual sound
  track is <a href="guidance.wav">here</a>.

What if Gronk has a baby? Then there’s a new Baby Gronk. This would mean Baby Gronk becomes Toddler Gronk.

Then Baby Gronk beats Toddler Gronk 1 v 1, causing Livvy to rizz up the Baby Gronk, making Baby Gronk the new Drip King. He also beats Baby Diggs 1 v 1. So now he’s the new Drip King, Rizz King, and the new Baby Diggs. Toddler Gronk transfers due to lack of rizz, Baby Diggs is the old drip king, the old Drip King has no rizz.

Perhaps related, Rockwell created this brief video of a
research project to build a Retroencabulator. The video is at

Though uncredited in the video, this is actually based upon
earlier work by JH Quick in a paper entitled Turboencabulator
which can be read
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ids/dotdot/misc/jokes/turboencabulator.txt">here</a>.

In fact there is a Wikipedia entry,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboencabulator">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboencabulator</a>
which gives a much better history, and has a link to another excellent video,
from Chrysler.
